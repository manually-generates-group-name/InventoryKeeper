# Inventory Keeper Project for CS4800
Inventory Keeper is a website which allows for the user to create lists as well as manage them through editing and deletion. The website allows for shareable links, allowing the user to share their lists with friends or family. The goal of this project was to allow users to keep all of their lists in one place, whether it be for school, groceries, etc.

## Documentation
The backend of Inventory Keeper consists of Node.js and Express.js to handle API requests. Data is stored into a MongoDB database, ensuring that the user's lists are kept in memory. The frontend consists of React.js as well as axios to handle the routing of API requests to the backend.
